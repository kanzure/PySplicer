    Dictionary must contain at least 'title' and 'sequence' keys. It may also
    contain 'accession' and 'comments' keys.

    This function throws an AssertionError if "sequence" or "title" keys are
    missing, or if not a dict, or if not all "comments" keys are integers.

    Accession should be a string, and will be prepended to output title.

    Comments should be a dictionary, with each key being the numeric string
    index where the comment is to occur, with the value being the comment, like
    so: {12:"Comment at position 12"}

    Comments are prepended with ';' as specced for FASTA, but are not
    compatible with many/most software packages.

    wraplines is the number of characters to print per line before wrapping to
    next line.
